Integrated Pipeline for Genome-Wide Association Studies

IPGWAS was developed to facilitate the identification of the rational thresholds in QC of GWAS datasets, association analysis, Manhattan plot, quantile-quantile (QQ) plot, and format conversion for genetic analyses, such as meta-analysis, genotype phasing, and imputation. IPGWAS is a multiplatform application written in Perl with a graphical user interface (GUI) and available for free at http://sourceforge.net/projects/ipgwas/.
